"""
Tile Generation Module

Implements map tile generation for basemap data processing pipeline.
Supports multiple tile formats and zoom levels for various use cases
including automotive, logistics, consumer applications, and gaming.

This module demonstrates expertise in:
- Vector tile generation (MVT format)
- Multi-scale cartographic processing
- Spatial indexing and optimization
- Tile caching and distribution
- Performance optimization for large datasets
- Integration with Mapbox Tiling Service patterns
